Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard developed using PowerBI. This project offers insightful visualizations and analysis of road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022, providing valuable insights into accident trends, casualties, and contributing factors.

**Key Features:**

- **Primary KPIs:** Total Casualties and Total Accident values for the current year and year-over-year (YoY) growth, along with Total Casualties by Accident Severity.
- **Secondary KPIs:** Total Casualties categorized by vehicle type for the current year.
- **Monthly Trend Analysis:** Comparison of monthly casualties for the current year and the previous year, revealing seasonal variations and trends.
- **Casualties by Road Type:** Distribution of casualties based on road types for the current year, identifying accident hotspots.
- **Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night:** Analysis of casualties by geographic areas/locations and day/night time periods for the current year, highlighting risk areas and time-specific trends.
- **Total Casualties and Accidents by Location:** Visual representation of total casualties and accidents by location, providing a geographical perspective on accident impact.
